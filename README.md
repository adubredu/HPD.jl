# HPD.jl: Hybrid PDDL Description parser
## Parser for the Hybrid PDDL Description language for parsing Hybrid PDDL files.

HPD is an extension of PDDL to enable the specification of numerical constraints
of arbitrary forms (linear, quadratic, cubic, nonlinear, trigonometric, etc.) as 
well as the specification of continuous variables, continuous action preconditions,
continuous action effects, action dynamics functions, and arbitrary objective functions.

## Examples
To be included soon.

This package extends and heavily relies on [ztangent's](https://github.com/ztangent/) awesome [PDDL.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlanners/PDDL.jl) package.
